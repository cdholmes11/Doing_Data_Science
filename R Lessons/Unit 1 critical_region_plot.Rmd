# Plotting Shaded Critical Regions
## Drawing Density Curves and Shaded Regions

```{r}

# First let's look at a normal curve
# the function for generating values from the normal density is dnorm()
# by default dnorm() fits the density for a standard normal
dnorm(0) # the density of a standard normal at 0

# we can specify arguments for the mean and sd
dnorm(0, sd = 2) # density at x=0, for a normal with mean 0 but sd=2 instead of 1
dnorm(0, mean = 1) # density at x=0, for a normal with mean 1 and sd still 1
dnorm(0, 3, 2) # density at x=0, for a normal with mean 3 and sd 2

# dnorm() can take a vector of arguments
# use this to generate data for density plots
# first create x values, using seq, from -4 to 4 by .01 increments
x <- seq(-4, 4, by = .01)

# now we get normal density and we plot
y <- dnorm(x)

# however, dt() does NOT have a mean and sd, but requires a degrees of freedom
