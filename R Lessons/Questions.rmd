```{r}
## what is the 'function' portion of the function doing?
## it appears to be redundant because you are defining a function immediately after it
sapply(diamonds, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

df %>% filter(str_detect(quotes,"John Wooden")) # not finding quotes

# Why is it in Brackets?
importantWords = theText[!str_detect(theText,regex(wordsToTakeOut,ignore_case = TRUE))]
```

## How did we calculate the regression line?
## ln 573 of Unit 3 Transformations.Rmd

## What are factors?
