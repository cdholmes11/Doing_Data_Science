# Part 1

```{r}
# Import Data
fifa <- read.csv("C:/Users/corey/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science/Unit 3/FIFA Players.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Question 1
## Using the FIFA player data set, filter the data set to create a Dataframe
## that has just the Left Midfilders (LM) and Left Forwards (LF)
```{r}
fifa_left <- fifa %>% filter(Position == "LM" | Position == "LF")
```

## Question 2
## Use Ggally and ggpairs() and the dataset you created above, to plot the 
## categorical variable Position (LM and LF), versus the continuous variables 
## Acceleration and Agility.
```{r}
fifa_left %>%
    select(Acceleration, Agility, Position) %>%
    ggpairs(aes(color = Position))
```

## Question 3
## Given the plot above, what relationships do you see?
```{r}
# Agility and Acceleration appear to have a positive linear coorelation.
# LF appear to be more agile.
```

## Question 4
## Test if the mean agaility rating of left midfielders (LM) is different than
## that of the left forwards (LF). Perform a 6 step t-test to test the 
## difference of these means.
```{r}
# Variables
alpha <- .05
fifa_agil <-
    fifa_left %>%
    select(Position, Agility)

## n values
n <- fifa_agil %>%
    select(Position) %>%
    group_by(Position) %>%
    summarize(count = n())
n1 <- n %>%
    filter(Position == "LF") %>%
    select(count)
n2 <- n %>%
    filter(Position == "LM") %>%
    select(count)

# Step 1
## ho: mu1 = mu2 # nolint
## ha: mu1 <> mu2 # nolint

# Step 2
## Critical Value
critval <- qt(alpha / 2, n1$count + n2$count - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
critval

# Step 3
## t-value

## Assuming unequal variance
ttest <- t.test(Agility ~ Position, data = fifa_agil)
tstat <- ttest$statistic
tstat

## Assuming equal variance
ttest2 <- t.test(Agility ~ Position, data = fifa_agil, var.equal = TRUE)
tstat2 <- ttest$statistic
tstat2


# Step 4
## p-value
pval <- ttest$p.val
pval

pval2 <- ttest2$p.val
pval2

# Step 5
# Reject/Fail to reject Ho
## Fail to reject Ho
ttest
ttest2

# Step 6
## There is not enough evidence to suggest that the mean agility rating of
## Left Midfilders is different from Left Forwards (p = 0.06314)
```

## Question 5
## Are the assumptions of this test reasonably met?
## Do you think the sampling distribution of sample means will be reasonably normal?
## Does there look like there is significant visual evidence to suggest the standard deviations are different?
```{r}
# Histograms of each Position split up because the number of LM makes it
# difficult to see LF charts when put on the same axis
fifa_agil %>%
    filter(Position == "LF") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Agility)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "#6060d8")

fifa_agil %>%
    filter(Position == "LM") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Agility)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "red")

# Box Plots to evaluate spread
box <-
    fifa_agil %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Position, y = Agility, fill = Position)) +
    geom_boxplot()
ggplotly(box)
```
 
# Part 2

## Select/create at least 2 categorical variables and select two continuous 
## variables and perform an EDA.  Also, at least one of the categorical 
## variables should be created from a continuous variable (using the cut() 
## function).

## Nationality, Wages, Position, Age, Overall

## Players by Nationality
## Overall by Nationality
## Highest Wages by Position
## Most valued Stat by position based on compensation of position
